# DecisionTree_Induction_Algorithm
Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm in Python3.

Decision Tree Induction Algorithm is implemented in this project. This algorithm is mainly used for classification-based problems in order to make decisions between various outcomes. The algorithm can handle high dimensional data and the accuracy of the algorithm is considered to be very efficient but depends on the dataset as well.

The algorithm is implemented to run for three attribute selection metrrics - Information Gain, Gain Ratio and Gini Index.
